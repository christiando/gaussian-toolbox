# WARNING: editing this file will impact the behavior of renku commands
# by telling renku to *not track* listed files with git LFS.
#
# By default, renku commands track all files above the renku configured lfs_threshold
# with git LFS to prevent accidentally checking in large files (default=100kb).
# You can update this threshold by calling 'renku config lfs_threshold <size>kb'.
#
# Use this file to specify particular paths to *not track* with LFS regardless of
# their size. The syntax is the same as .gitignore (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
# Remember: files listed here, when generated during renku commands, will add to
# the size of your repo, and could slow things down.
#
# See https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/renku-project-template for proper
# usage.

# Warning: modifying the next line will check generated ipynb files (e.g. from papermill) into LFS: 
# they will no longer be displayed in the renku UI
